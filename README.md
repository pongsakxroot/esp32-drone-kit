# ESP32 Drone Kit Example

This project includes schematic, PCB layout, firmware, and BOM for a basic ESP32-based drone kit.

## Structure

- `EasyEDA/esp32_drone_schematic.json` - EasyEDA schematic file
- `EasyEDA/esp32_drone_pcb.json` - EasyEDA PCB layout file
- `firmware/esp32_drone_main.ino` - Main controller firmware
- `firmware/esp32_drone_pid.ino` - PID stabilization example
- `docs/BOM.md` - Bill of Materials

## Getting Started

1. Flash the firmware to your ESP32 board.
2. Assemble components as per schematic and PCB files.
3. Review BOM for part sourcing.
